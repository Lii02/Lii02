# Conventions
## Comments
Single line comments should have spacing after the slashes, like so:
```
// This is a comment
/* This is another comment */
```
Multiline comments should only be used for documentation, and should follow single lines spacing rules, like so:
```
/*
* This is a documentation comment
*/
```
Commented code is not allowed:
```
/*printf("Hello");
printf("World");*/
```
