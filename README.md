## About Me
I am a software developer with a focus on game development, seeking a new opportunity to apply my skills and experience to create innovative software and games. I have a strong understanding of JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Git, SQL, HTML, CSS, Python, C#, and Java. In my previous roles, I have developed a variety of software, including a sign-in system using React and Flask, an FPS dungeon game with gameplay, audio, AI, and UI programming, and worked on a game for Universal Phoenix Group. I am a creative and passionate developer who is always eager to learn new things and take on new challenges. I am confident that I have the skills and experience necessary to be a valuable asset to any team.
